  abstract = {This study examined how a suite of habitat and environmental variables relate to the ability of a stream surveyor to identify (observer efficiency) and distinguish (observer accuracy) steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) redds from other stream features. Two existing spawning survey protocols that included one or two redd observers were used to develop models to estimate redd observer error. In most cases, steelhead redd abundances using raw redd counts were underestimated. Mean annual rates of observer efficiency ranged from 0.44 to 0.57, and observer accuracy ranged from 0.67 to 0.83. Regardless of the observer error model used, adjusted annual redd abundance estimates were generally unbiased (range 1.6\textendash 0.6 redds). A Gaussian area-under-the-curve methodology that incorporates redd count data and observer error rates was used to generate unbiased estimates of steelhead redd abundance in the Wenatchee (170 redds, coefficient of variation (CV) = 44\%) and Methow (106 redds, CV = 41\%) rivers. Unbiased estimates of redd abundance will help inform new population viability analyses to better prioritize those populations with the greatest conservation need.},

  abstract = {The primary conservation prioritization tool for spring Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), population viability analysis, is often conducted with biased spawner abundance data with no associated statistical uncertainty or error. This study estimated observation error of surveyors counting redds in two spring Chinook Salmon populations where hatchery supplementation is implemented as a conservation tool. Habitat complexity, redd density and the amount of observer experience were important in estimating error rates. Increases in both habitat complexity and experience reduced net error rates. Conversely, net error rates increased as redd density increased. Unbiased estimates of redd abundance were generated and converted to spawner abundance using population specific redd expansion factors. The precision (i.e., coefficient of variation [CV]) of spawner abundance estimates were similar in the Wenatchee (natural CV = 5\%; hatchery CV = 6\%) and Methow (natural CV = 5\%; hatchery CV = 2\%) watersheds because average net error rates were similar (Wenatchee = -0.1512; Methow = -0.1748). This study addresses a criticism of population viability analysis (i.e., parameter uncertainty) that should result in more scientifically defensible conservation priorities and recommendations that can be implemented with greater certainty.},
