\arguments{
\item{redd_df}{dataframe containing redd data, including estimates of observer error}

\item{species}{which species is being analyzed? This function chooses the appropriate error model for this species. Choices are \code{Steelhead} or \code{Chinook}, with \code{Steelhead} being the default.}

\item{group_vars}{vector of column names from {redd_df} to group results by}

\item{summ_vars}{vector of column names from {redd_df} to group summaries of redd results by}

\item{new_redd_nm}{quoted name of column in {redd_df} listing number of new redds found during that survey}

\item{vis_redd_nm}{quoted name of column in {redd_df} listing number of visible redds present during that survey}

\item{net_err_nm}{quoted name of column in {redd_df} listing estimate of net error for that survey}

\item{net_se_nm}{quoted name of column in {redd_df} listing standard error of net error estimate for that survey}

\item{min_non0_wks}{minimum number of weeks with at least one new redd observed}

\item{min_redds}{minimum number of total redds observed}

\item{gauc}{\code{TRUE/FALSE} should a Gaussian area-under-the-curve model be applied? If \code{FALSE}, the total number of new redds is divided by the mean estimate of observer error. By default \code{gauc} is \code{TRUE} for steelhead, and \code{FALSE} for Spring Chinook.}

\item{add_zeros}{should leading and trailing zero counts be added if the first and last counts aren't already zero? Default is {FALSE}.}

\item{use_cor}{should correlations between reaches be used in calculating standard errors? Default is {FALSE}}

\item{date_nm}{quoted name of column in {redd_df} listing date of each survey}

\item{cor_redd_nm}{quoted name of column in {redd_df} listing number of redds found during that survey, to be used in the correlation}

\item{reach_nm}{quoted name of column in {redd_df} listing name of reach}

\item{use}{an optional character string giving a
    method for computing covariances in the presence
    of missing values.  This must be (an abbreviation of) one of the strings
    \code{"everything"}, \code{"all.obs"}, \code{"complete.obs"},
    \code{"na.or.complete"}, or \code{"pairwise.complete.obs"}.}

\item{method}{a character string indicating which correlation
    coefficient (or covariance) is to be computed.  One of
    \code{"pearson"} (default), \code{"kendall"}, or \code{"spearman"}:
    can be abbreviated.}

\description{
Estimates true number of redds across a series of reaches, using a Gaussian area-under-the-curve model where possible and incorporating estimates of observer error if possible. These estimates are then summarized across a user-defined spatial scale.
